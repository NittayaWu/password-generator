# password-generator

## Description:

This application is a password generator made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to allow users to create a strong, secure random password based upon their criteria set. This project included a starter code which had all the HTML, CSS and partial JavaScript already written. The programer had to provide the rest of the JavaScript code and ensure that the fuctions executed the application as intended. 

## Execution: 
 To use the application, the user should open the app on a web browser. Once open, the user should click on the red "Generate Password" button. In the scrpt.js file, there is an eventListener fuction that awaits the user's click on the button to procede the series of action that will occur. Once the button is clicked, the user is prompted with a message, "How many characters would you like in your password? (password length must be between 8-128 characters.". If the user enters a value outside the set parameters, they received the following message, "Password length must be a numerical digit from 8 - 128. Please try again.". When the user enters a valid number, they are then asked which character type they would like to include in their password. They have the options of choosing from uppercase alphabetical characters, lowercase alphabetical characters, numerical characters, and special characters. They may choose all types or available characters, one type of character, or certain selected types of characters. When the user has answered all the prompts, then a password is generated that matches their criteria. Once the password is generated, it is written on the page in the "Your Secure Password" dotted box. The user can then copy and paste the password to their intended location.
